# Task Management

## Workflow
1. **Create**: New tasks go into `active/`.
2. **Execute**: Work on the task, updating its status.
3. **Archive**: When complete, move to `archive/YYYY-MM/` (or similar).

## Directory Structure
- `active/`: Messages and context for CURRENTLY running agents.
- `archive/`: Completed task logs for history.
