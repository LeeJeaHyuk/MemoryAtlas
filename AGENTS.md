# Project Memory System (.memory)

This repository uses a standardized documentation structure located in `.memory/`.

## Rules for Agents
1. Source of Truth: Always read `.memory/00_INDEX.md` first.
2. Context Update: When requirements or architecture change, update the relevant files in `.memory/`.
3. Task Tracking: Before starting work, check `.memory/03_MANAGEMENT/STATUS.md` and `.memory/03_MANAGEMENT/tasks/`.
4. Consistency: If a new requirement conflicts with existing docs, reconcile before coding.
