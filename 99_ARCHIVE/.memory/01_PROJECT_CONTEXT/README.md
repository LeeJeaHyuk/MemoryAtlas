# Project Context

This folder defines the project identity, boundaries, and agent protocol.
It is the starting point for humans and AI agents.

## Core Files

- `00_GOALS.md`: project identity, scope, and success criteria
- `01_CONVENTIONS.md`: coding rules and boundaries (must read first)
- `04_AGENT_GUIDE.md`: collaboration protocol for agents

## Mental Model

- Documents are authority; code is a derived artifact.
- The workflow is **Intake -> Plan -> Execute**.
- Touchpoints for humans are Brief (Intake) and RUN (Plan).
- Intake must be executed via MCP; if MCP is unavailable, stop and fix MCP first.

## Where to Start

1. Read `01_CONVENTIONS.md` (Boundaries section).
2. Read `00_GOALS.md` for scope and intent.
3. Use `04_AGENT_GUIDE.md` to align agent behavior.
